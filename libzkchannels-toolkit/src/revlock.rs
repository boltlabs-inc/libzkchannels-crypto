//! This library describes revocation pairs, a formalization of hash locks.
//!
//! A pair ([`RevocationLock`], [`RevocationSecret`]) satisfy two properties:
//!
//! *Correctness*: A correctly generated revocation pair will always verify.
//!
//! ```
//! use libzkchannels_toolkit::{revlock::*, types::Verification};
//! use rand;
//! let rs = RevocationSecret::new(&mut rand::thread_rng());
//! let rl = rs.revocation_lock();
//! assert_eq!(rl.verify(&rs), Verification::verifies);
//! ```
//!
//! *Security*: Given a revocation lock, an adversary can generate a correct revocation secret with negligible probability (e.g. basically never)
//!
