/*!
This library describes revocation pairs, a formalization of hash locks.

A pair ([`RevocationLock`], [`RevocationSecret`]) satisfy two properties:

*Correctness*: A correctly generated revocation pair will always verify.

```ignore
# use libzkchannels_toolkit::{revlock::*, Verification};
# use rand::thread_rng;
let rs = RevocationSecret::new(&mut thread_rng());
let rl = rs.revocation_lock();
match rl.verify(&rs) {
    Verification::Verified => (),
    Verification::Failed => assert!(false),
}
```

NOTE: un-ignore this doctest once things are implemented

*Security*: Given a revocation lock, an adversary can generate a correct revocation secret with negligible probability (e.g. basically never)
