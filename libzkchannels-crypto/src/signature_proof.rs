Proofs of knowledge of a signature - that is, a proof that one knows the
underlying message.

These are Schnorr zero-knowledge proofs that use a commitment and response phase to show
that the prover knows the opening of a signature, without revealing the underlying [`Message`].

## Intuition
This is a Schnorr-style implementation of the efficient protocol from Pointcheval-Sanders \[1\],
which defines a randomizable, blindable signature scheme. The proof itself is based on the Schnorr
proof of knowledge of the opening of a commitment \[2\], but adds an additional preparation step
to adapt it for signatures.

The protocol has four phases to prove knowledge of a signature.

0. *Setup*. The prover blinds and randomizes the signature and forms a commitment to the underlying
    message. They use the same blinding factor to blind the signature and to form the commitment.

1. *Commit*. The prover chooses random commitment scalars for each element in the message tuple and
    for the blinding factor. They form a commitment to the commitment scalars. The outputs of steps
    0 and 1 is described by [`SignatureProofBuilder`].

2. *Challenge*. In an interactive proof, the prover obtains a random challenge from the verifier.
    However, it is standard practice to use the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to transform an interactive
    proof into a non-interactive proof; see [`Challenge`] for details.

3. *Response*. The prover constructs response scalars, which mask each element of the message tuple
    and the blinding factor with the corresponding commitment scalar and the challenge.

Note that steps 1-3 are identical to those for a [commitment proof](crate::commitment_proof).
The [`SignatureProof`] consists of the commitment to the commitment scalars; the response scalars;
the blinded, randomized signature; and the commitment to the message tuple from step 0.

Given the proof, the verifier checks the following:
1. The underlying commitment proof is consistent (i.e. with the commitment to commitment scalars,
    the challenge, and the responses scalars).
2. The (blinded, randomized) signature is valid.
3. The signature is consistent with the commitment to the message.

A malicious prover cannot produce a valid, consistent set of objects without knowing the underlying
message.
