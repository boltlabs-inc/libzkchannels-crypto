//! Cryptographic routines to establish a new merchant, establish customer channels, and
//! process payments.
//! A merchant is essentially a stateless object, so nearly all these functions are atomic API calls on
//! the merchant configuration [`Config`].
//!
//! **Important:** Most of these API calls have a documented **Usage** requirement: typically, the
//! merchant must ensure that certain parameters are *fresh*, and have never been seen before.
//! These checks *must* be made for a correct zkAbacus execution.
//!
//! ## Init
//! A merchant initializes itself by creating parameters that will be used over its entire lifetime.
//!
//! ## Establish
//! This is a two-phase process. First, the merchant must [`initialize()`](Config::initialize())
//! a given channel id, which verifies that the customer has correctly set up the channel state.
//! Once initialized, it must [`activate()`](Config::activate()) the
//! channel to allow the customer to begin making payments.
//!
//! ## Pay
//! This is also a two-phase process, with an intermediate state. First, the merchant receives a
//! payment request and decides whether to [`allow_payment()`](Config::allow_payment()), making sure the
//! request is well-formed and valid. If so, it enters the [`Unrevoked`] state, indicating that
//! the customer has not yet revoked the previous channel state. At this point, the customer cannot
//! make another payment. Once the customer revokes the previous state, the
//! merchant can [`complete_payment()](Unrevoked::complete_payment()) and allow the customer to make
//! new payments once again.
//!
//! ## Close
//! The merchant can process a close request from the customer with
//! [`check_close_signature`](Config::check_close_signature()).
//!
//!
//!
//!
//!
