/*!
Defines the state of a channel and transformations on that state used in the zkAbacus
protocol.

The primary type is a [`State`], which describes a zkChannel at a point in time. The protocol
applies several transformations to this object to generate the customer outputs of the zkAbacus.Pay
subprotocol: a [`PayToken`] and a [`CloseStateSignature`]. For each of these outputs, the flow
goes as follows:

1. the customer blinds an input,
2. the merchant verifies (in zero knowledge) that the input is correctly formed,
3. the merchant produces a blinded version of the output, and
4. the customer unblinds the output.

To produce a [`PayToken`], the customer blinds the [`State`] with a [`PayTokenBlindingFactor`].
This produces a [`StateCommitment`], which the merchant signs to produce a [`BlindedPayToken`].

To produce a [`CloseStateSignature`], the customer blinds the [`CloseState`] with a
[`CloseStateBlindingFactor`]. This produces a [`CloseStateCommitment`], which the merchant signs
to produce a [`CloseStateBlindedSignature`].

The customer must blind the input and unblind the output with the _same_ blinding factor.
