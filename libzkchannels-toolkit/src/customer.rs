/*!
Cryptographic routines for establishing, making payments on, and closing a channel.

## Establish

Channel establishment for the customer has two phases. First, the customer _initializes_ the
channel. They form a [`RequestMessage`] that proves they have correctly formed the channel
state with respect to the agreed-upon balances and enter the [`Requested`]
state.

On receiving a valid [`ClosingSignature`](crate::ClosingSignature), they
[`complete()`](Requested::complete()) the initialize phase and enter the [`Inactive`] state.

In the second phase, the customer _activates_ the channel. On receiving a valid
[`PayToken`](crate::PayToken), they enter the [`Ready`] state.

## Pay

Payments on a channel have three phases. The customer begins in the [`Ready`] state.

First, the customer begins the payment protocol. Using an agreed-upon amount, they
[`start()`](Ready::start()) the payment and enter the [`Started`] state.
This produces a [`StartMessage`], which proves that they have correctly updated the
channel state with respect to the payment amount.

On receiving a [`ClosingSignature`](crate::ClosingSignature), the customer can
[`lock()`](Started::lock()) the channel and enter the [`Locked`] state.
This produces a [`LockMessage`], which revokes the old channel state;
at this point, the customer _cannot_ make another payment.

On receiving a [`PayToken`](crate::PayToken), the payment is complete and customer returns to the
[`Ready`] state.

## Close

The customer has the option to close at multiple points in the protocol:

- [`Inactive`]. A channel that hasn't been activated can still close on the original balances.
- [`Ready`]. A channel can close on the current balances.
- [`Started`]. After a payment has been started, the customer can close on either the previous
or current balances.
- [`Locked`]. A locked channel can close on the current balances.
