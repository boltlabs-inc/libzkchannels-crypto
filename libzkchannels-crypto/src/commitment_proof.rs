Proofs of knowledge of an opening of a Pedersen commitment.

These are Schnorr zero-knowledge proofs that use a commitment and response phase to show
that the prover knows an opening of a commitment, without revealing the underlying [`Message`].

## Intuition
This implements the original Schnorr protocol \[1\], leaving the challenge phase undefined.

The protocol has three phases.
1. *Commit*. The prover chooses random commitment scalars for each message in the tuple and the
    commitment randomness. They
    form a commitment to this randomness with the same parameters that were used to form the
    original commitment. The output of this step is described by [`CommitmentProofBuilder`].

2. *Challenge*. In an interactive proof, the prover obtains a random challenge from the verifier.
    However, it is standard practice to use the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to transform an interactive
    proof into a non-interactive proof; see [`Challenge`] for details.

3. *Response*. The prover constructs response scalars, which mask each element of the message tuple
    and the blinding factor with the corresponding commitment scalar and the challenge.

The [`CommitmentProof`] consists of the commitment to the commitment scalars and the response
scalars.

Given the proof and the commitment, the verifier checks the consistency of the commitment (to the
original message), the commitment to randomness, the challenge, and the responses. A malicious
prover cannot produce a consistent set of objects without knowing the underlying message and
blinding factor.
