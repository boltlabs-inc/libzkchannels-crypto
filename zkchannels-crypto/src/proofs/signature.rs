//! Proofs of knowledge of a signature - that is, a proof that one knows the underlying message.
//!
//! These are Schnorr zero-knowledge proofs that use a commitment and response phase to show that
//! the prover knows the opening of a signature, without revealing the underlying [`Message`].
//!
//! ## Intuition
//! This is a Schnorr-style implementation of the efficient protocol from Pointcheval-Sanders \[1\],
//! which defines a randomizable, blindable signature scheme. The proof itself is based on the
//! Schnorr proof of knowledge of the opening of a commitment \[2\], but adds an additional
//! preparation step to adapt it for signatures.
//!
//! The protocol has four phases to prove knowledge of a signature.
//!
//! 0. *Setup*. The prover blinds and randomizes the signature and forms a commitment to the
//!     underlying message. They use the same blinding factor to blind the signature and to form the
//!     commitment.
//!
//! 1. *Commit*. The prover chooses random commitment scalars for each element in the message tuple
//!     and for the blinding factor. They form a commitment to the commitment scalars. The outputs
//!     of steps 0 and 1 is described by [`SignatureProofBuilder`].
//!
//! 2. *Challenge*. In an interactive proof, the prover obtains a random challenge from the
//!     verifier. However, it is standard practice to use the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to transform an
//!     interactive proof into a non-interactive proof; see [`Challenge`] for details.
//!
//! 3. *Response*. The prover constructs response scalars, which mask each element of the message
//!     tuple and the blinding factor with the corresponding commitment scalar and the challenge.
//!
//! Note that steps 1-3 are identical to those for a [commitment proof](crate::commitment_proof).
//! The [`SignatureProof`] consists of the commitment to the commitment scalars; the response
//! scalars; the blinded, randomized signature; and the commitment to the message tuple from step 0.
//!
//! Given the proof, the verifier checks the following:
//! 1. The underlying commitment proof is consistent (i.e. with the commitment to commitment
//!     scalars, the challenge, and the responses scalars).
//! 2. The (blinded, randomized) signature is valid.
//! 3. The signature is consistent with the commitment to the message.
//!
//! A malicious prover cannot produce a valid, consistent set of objects without knowing the
//! underlying message.
