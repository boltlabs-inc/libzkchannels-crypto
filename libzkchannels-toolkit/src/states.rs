//! Defines the state of a channel and transformations on that state used in the zkChannels
//! protocol.
//!
//! The primary type is a [`State`], which describes a zkChannel at a point in time. The protocol
//! applies several transformations to this object to generate the correct outputs of the Pay
//! subprotocol: a [`PayToken`] and a [`CloseStateSignature`]. For each of these outputs, the flow
//! goes as follows:
//!
//! 1. the customer blinds an input,
//! 2. the merchant verifies (in zero knowledge) that the input is correctly formed,
//! 3. the merchant produces a blinded version of the output, and
//! 4. the customer unblinds the output.
//!
//! To produce a [`PayToken`], the customer blinds the [`State`] with a [`PayTokenBlindingFactor`].
//! This produces a [`StateCommitment`], which the merchant signs to produce a [`BlindedPayToken`].
//!
//! To produce a [`CloseStateSignature`], the customer blinds the [`CloseState`] with a
//! [`CloseStateBlindingFactor`]. This produces a [`CloseStateCommitment`], which the merchant signs
//! to produce a [`CloseStateBlindedSignature`].
//!
//! The customer must blind the input and unblind the output with the _same_ blinding factor.
