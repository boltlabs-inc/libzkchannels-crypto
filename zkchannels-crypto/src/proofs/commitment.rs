//! Proofs of knowledge of an opening of a Pedersen commitment.
//!
//! These are Schnorr zero-knowledge proofs that use a commitment and response phase to show that
//! the prover knows an opening of a commitment, without revealing the underlying [`Message`].
//!
//! ## Intuition
//! This implements the original Schnorr protocol \[1\], leaving the challenge phase undefined.
//!
//! The protocol has three phases.
//! 1. *Commit*. The prover chooses random commitment scalars for each message in the tuple and the
//!     commitment randomness. They form a commitment to this randomness with the same parameters
//!     that were used to form the original commitment. The output of this step is described by
//!     [`CommitmentProofBuilder`].
//!
//! 2. *Challenge*. In an interactive proof, the prover obtains a random challenge from the
//!     verifier. However, it is standard practice to use the Fiat-Shamir heuristic to transform an
//!     interactive proof into a non-interactive proof; see [`Challenge`] for details.
//!
//! 3. *Response*. The prover constructs response scalars, which mask each element of the message
//!     tuple and the blinding factor with the corresponding commitment scalar and the challenge.
//!
//! The [`CommitmentProof`] consists of the commitment to the commitment scalars and the response
//! scalars.
//!
//! Given the proof and the commitment, the verifier checks the consistency of the commitment (to
//! the original message), the commitment to randomness, the challenge, and the responses. A
//! malicious prover cannot produce a consistent set of objects without knowing the underlying
//! message and blinding factor.
//!
